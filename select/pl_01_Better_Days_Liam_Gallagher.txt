There'll be better days
when the sun gets into you
And the shadows of your heart
There'll be better days
when my love will find you
Even though we're miles apart
Like an aeroplane,
as the world fades out
And there's a new world
yet to come
And all your pain will release
at night
Into the arms of the chosen one
If you're lost,
I'll find you there
With the sunlights in your hair
And the sadness washed away
by the rain
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
You say you can't open up
you're eyes
'cause you're reelin'
Baby, try to remember,
it's just a feelin'
And there'll be better waves
that begin to wet
Gone through the wasteland of
your mind
Through the Milky Way,
oh, my love will hold you
Hope it gets you
through the night
Don't believe the little lies
Underneath the darkened skies
Stand up, I'll meet you there
in the rain
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
Come on, you know
Come on, you know
Come on
If you're lost,
I'll find you there
With the sunlights in your hair
All the sadness washed away
with the rain
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
