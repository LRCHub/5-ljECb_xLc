Now that i'm alone again
After all these years
Of having someone to share my thoughts with
Simplicity is gone my friend
I thought it'd be a good thing
But now i know
I need someone everyday
Something in the same way

Still i hope for better days to come
You made up your mind
But maybe i can change it back again
You tell me give it time my friend
You think i just someone
But i need you
Just a moment everyday
And i can't see it changing
