Words don't come too easy
Sometimes i'm scared of you
So here i sit and wonder
What it takes to talk to you

Cause i'm fucked up
And you're fucked up
In a fucked up situation
You're frozen
And i'm broken
Can't we just start anew?

Tell me what to do
What to do
Tell me what to do
Can't we start anew?
Tell me what to do

Words don't come too easy
Sometimes i wish they would
Please help me kill the silence
Before it kills us two

Cause you're fucked up
And you're fucked up
In a fucked up situation
I'm frozen
And you're broken
Can't we just start anew?

Tell me what to do
What to do
Tell me what to do
Can't we start anew?
Tell me what to do

Tell me what to do
What to do
Tell me what to do
Can't we start anew?
Tell me what to do
