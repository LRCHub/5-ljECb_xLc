There'll be better days when the sun gets into you
And the shadows of your heart
There'll be better days when my love will find you
Even though we're miles apart
Like an aeroplane, as the world fades out
And there's a new world yet to come
And all your pain will release at night
Into the arms of the chosen one
If you're lost, I'll find you there
With the sunlight in your hair
And the sadness washed away by the rain
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
You say you can't open up your eyes 'cause you're reeling
Baby, try to remember it's just a feeling
And there'll be better waves that begin to wet
Gone through the wasteland of your mind
Through the Milky Way, oh, my love will hold you
Hope it gets you through the night
Don't believe that it's all lies
Underneath the darkened skies
Stand up, I'll meet you there in the rain
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
Come on, you know
Come on, you know
Come on
If you're lost, I'll find you there
With the sunlight in your hair
All the sadness washed away with the rain
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
Believe me, yeah
