```lrc
[00:29.63] There'll be better days when the sun gets into you
[00:33.51] And the shadows of your heart
[00:37.02] There'll be better days when my love will find you even though we're miles apart
[01:17.02] 
[00:44.33] Like an aeroplane, as the world fades out
[00:48.24] And there's a new world yet to come
[00:52.34] And all your pain will release at night into the arms of the chosen one
[01:27.84] 
[01:00.52] If you're lost, I'll find you there with the sunlight in your hair
[01:07.96] And the sadness washed away by the rain
[01:27.46] 
[01:14.49] Believe me, yeah
[01:21.87] Believe me, yeah
[01:29.87] 
[01:30.09] You say you can't open up your eyes 'cause you're reeling
[01:37.88] Baby, try to remember it's just a feeling
[01:44.45] And there'll be better waves that begin to wet
[01:48.29] Gone through the wasteland of your mind
[01:52.04] Through the Milky Way, oh, my love will hold you
[01:55.92] Hope it gets you through the night
[02:12.92] 
[02:00.53] Don't believe that it's all lies underneath the darkened skies
[02:08.19] Stand up, I'll meet you there in the rain
[02:28.69] 
[02:14.78] Believe me, yeah
[02:22.05] Believe me, yeah
[02:30.05] 
[02:44.76] Come on, you know
[02:48.26] Come on, you know
[02:52.15] Come on, you know
[03:00.65] 
[03:00.50] If you're lost, I'll find you there with the sunlight in your hair
[03:08.07] All the sadness washed away with the rain
[03:28.57] 
[03:14.51] Believe me, yeah
[03:21.97] Believe me, yeah
[03:29.34] Believe me, yeah
[03:37.08] Believe me, yeah
